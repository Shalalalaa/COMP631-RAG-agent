Abstract
Objective
This paper reviews the literature evaluating psychological treatments to improve sleep qual-
ity in young adult university students.
Method
Participants (N = 6179) were young adult (aged 18–30 years) university students. Data-
bases (PubMed, PsychInfo, EMBASE and Medline) were searched for randomized con-
trolled trials evaluating psychological treatments for sleep disturbance in university
students. The search date was 20 September 2024.
Results
22 original trials met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that psychological interven-
tions outperformed control groups (n = 14) on improving sleep quality (g = 0.50, 95%
CI:0.26–0.73). There were significantly different effect sizes found between studies that
evaluated cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I; n = 6, g = 0.72, CI: 0.43–1.02)
versus studies that evaluated mindfulness interventions (n = 5, g = 0.16, 95% CI: -0.18–
0.51).
Conclusions
Psychological treatments improve sleep quality for young adult university students. While
CBT-I showed larger effect sizes than interventions focused on mindfulness, further
research is needed to verify if this reflects a true difference in the efficacy of the
interventions.

 Introduction
Advances in sleep science have shown that persistent poor sleep, or insomnia, predisposes
individuals to develop mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety [1–4]. Sleep difficulties
can also worsen comorbid mental illness: increasing the likelihood of depression relapse [5];
prolonging the course of depression [6]; and blunting treatment effects [7]. As a consequence,
mental health clinicians and physicians now consider the effective treatment of sleep distur-
bance to be a priority [8]. This greater awareness of the fundamental role sleep plays in main-
taining physical and mental health, and the detrimental impact of sleep difficulties on mental
health, underscores the need for effective psychological interventions that improve sleep
quality.
The literature on treating sleep difficulties in general adult populations has shown that psy-
chological interventions are beneficial [9–11]. They are at least as effective as pharmacological
treatments for reducing sleep onset latency, improving sleep efficiency and self-reported sleep
quality [12], and therefore recommended as first line treatments [13]. There are a diverse
range of psychological treatments available for this age group, including mindfulness medita-
tion, relaxation, sleep hygiene and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). The
research evaluating psychological treatments, however, has rarely involved young adults or
university students with participants typically being middle aged and older adults [14]. Conse-
quently, it is unclear if the existing treatments are helpful for tertiary education students, who
are typically young adults in circumstances unique from other adults. For instance, students
often have living arrangements that make regular sleep routines difficult to sustain. Many stu-
dents reside in dorms, residential halls or share houses where late night social interactions may
encourage some students to delay their bedtime [15]. Alternatively, the noise made by other
students engaged in social activities can be a disruption to students who wish to sleep. Students
living with their family of origin, face different challenges to sleep. In these cases, students may
spend large amounts of time in their bedroom for activities that do not include sleep such as
studying and socialising online, making it difficult for students to develop a conditioned asso-
ciation between being in their bed with feeling sleepy [15, 16].
Given the circumstances of students is often not conducive to healthy sleep patterns, it is
not surprising that the prevalence rate of insomnia in university students is higher than what is
reported in the general population, where the point prevalence is approximately 6% [17]. For
example, a systematic review of studies exploring insomnia in university students, found
18.5% met criteria for insomnia disorder using validated scales [18]. In addition, there are
many young people who experience suboptimal sleep duration or quality. but do not meet cri-
teria for insomnia disorder. Studies with young adult university students report between 43%
and 66% are poor sleepers [16, 19].
Not only do university students experience elevated rates of sleep problems, but they also
have high rates of mental illness with 31% reporting a mental health disorder in the past twelve
months [20]. There is also evidence that the prevalence of mental health disorders in this popu-
lation has been steadily increasing; Lipson et al. [21] found the proportion of students with a
mental health disorder rose from 21.9% in 2007 to 35.5% in 2017. Improving sleep quality in
this population is important for many reasons. For example, sleep disturbance is an indepen-
dent risk factor for subsequent mental illness [4] and suicidal behaviour [1–4]. Furthermore,
untreated sleep disturbance may serve to maintain comorbid depression [22] and increase risk
of relapse [23].
There have been two systematic reviews that examined the efficacy of different forms of
psychological treatments to improve sleep in young adults, and included only randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) [24, 25]. Both reviews found psychological interventions improved

 sleep with a moderate effect size (g = 0.53; g = 0.61, respectively), however, a significant limita-
tion is that these reviews included only studies with non-active control groups (e.g., no inter-
vention, waitlist). The use of non-active control groups can lead to an overestimation of
intervention effect sizes [26], as such study designs do not control for participant expectations
or the experience of receiving treatment including contact with health care providers. These
factors not related specifically to the intervention being tested can contribute to symptom
improvement. Studies that make use of active controls (such as psychoeducation about sleep,
sleep hygiene information) are a valuable source of information that offer a more conservative
and potentially more accurate estimate of intervention effects. Since the most recent review
[24] conducted their search in April 2020, several important studies have been published
[27–32], four of these [28, 30–32] have investigated the effect of mindfulness on sleep quality
in students. Previously, there were very few RCTs examining mindfulness for sleep [24, 25].
The addition of these new studies potentially impacts treatment recommendations regarding
the use of mindfulness and warrants the need for an updated review.
To extend on previous reviews, we sought to conduct an updated systematic review and
meta-analysis of the relevant published RCTs of psychological interventions to improve sleep
quality in university students, including studies with both active and non-active control
groups. Studies reporting measures of comorbid psychopathology (e.g. anxiety and depres-
sion) and daytime functioning (such as quality of life and sleepiness) were noted in the narra-
tive summary. These measures give an indication of the ways in which psychological
treatments to improve sleep can impact daily life, giving a more complete picture of the utility
of such interventions [33].
The primary aim of this review was to synthesise the RCT literature examining psychologi-
cal treatments to improve sleep quality in young adult university students and use meta-ana-
lytic techniques to examine their efficacy relative to control groups in improving sleep quality.
A secondary aim was to compare the effect sizes of different psychological approaches to treat-
ing sleep disturbance in university students. A diverse range of psychological interventions
exist; however, it is unknown how specific treatment approaches compare to others in this
population. In keeping with the literature on"
