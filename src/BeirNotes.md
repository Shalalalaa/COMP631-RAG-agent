# My steps when choosing and implement the models
## _BEIR_

### Install the dependency
The environment I used is MacOS Docker
This follows the guide from github website ["Beir Github"]
1. Firstly I installed the Beir repository
   ```!pip install beir```
3. dowload the Elasticsearch from [Elasticsearch Website](https://www.elastic.co/cn/downloads/elasticsearch)
   [Docker version](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html)
   
   
5. Check if Elasticsearch can run?

   
   
6.
